This code is for example purposes and cannot be used without significant customizations to the Drupal 7 UI to add the requisite nodes, fields, etc. The add location repository is used in conjunction with one other custom Drupal 7 module (and a JavaScript repo developed by the JS team!) in order to render the Country Profiles that appear on www.healthdata.org/[location_name]. To see the finished product, navigate to a subnational location such as: www.healthdata.org/mexico-aguascalientes. Database names, fields, and values have been changed for security.
